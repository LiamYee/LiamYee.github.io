### CPSC 120

* Lab 5 Part 3 
In this lab we worked with for loops and if statements. What I enjoyed about it was that I saw a comparison with the for loops and which card value it was. The goal of the lab was to write a program that took card values and added them together to play the game Blackjack. Although it was a challenging lab it also offered a better learning experience for the if statements and for loops. One challenging part was getting the ace card value to be 1 or 11 depending if the 11 would make you go over 21 or not. 


* Lab 8 part 1
	This lab was one of my favorites because this is when I learned about the getline function. The goal of the lab was to use the getline function to read into other text files to find strings that were palindromes and print the ones that were more than 3 characters long.This part of the lab didn’t take very long but it covered the getline function well. 

* Lab 8 part 3
	In this lab it was one of the first times we’ve seen animations which made it a little more fun than the labs we have had in the past. The goal of this lab was to write a code that creates ASCII art. This section of the lab was at first confusing but as a team we were able to figure it out and got through it which was satisfying in the end. It was also the first time we were introduced to IOstreams which was an important lesson to be learned.
